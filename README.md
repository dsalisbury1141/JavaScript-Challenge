# We cannot be the only life out there.... or are we???
Recently the government has release fairly recent unidentified objects that have been the gossip of the nation for so long, way back since area 51 to this very moment. We will probably never know the real truth but it is fun explore the possibilities.

Way back on November 16, 1977 the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released, the ratings skyrocketed, if you haven't see the movie please entertain yourself get some popcorn and take a trip to the past. This movie hosted so many very young famous actors that began their career in those days. 

This is a classic image from the movie.
